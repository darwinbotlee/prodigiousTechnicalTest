Take care of the next steps for testing the asp.net webApi and the client asp.net MVC 5 application:

1. run both solutions in the localhost enviroment since those apps are not published on a Web server
2. review webApi application ports in the client asp.net MVC 5 application
3. login with user: darwinbotlee@hotmail.com and pass 012abcD. or registrer a new user in the webApi default connectionDB
4. only as an autenticated user the products menu option will be visible
5. test Index, Details, Edit and Create actions in the ProductController
